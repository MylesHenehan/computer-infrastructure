Since this file did not yet exist, the command created the file the first time it was run, and then appended the output to the same file the following 10 times. I used the up arrow when repeating the command so I wouldn't have to type it out each time. I then used the command **more now.txt** to verify that the text file contained the contents I wanted. I discovered I had only repeated the command 9 times instead of 10.\n",

For this, I ran the command **date \"+%Y%m%d_%H%M%S\" >> formatted.txt**, thus appending the formatted output to a new text file. Since I made quite a few mistakes in the format, I referred to the man page, using **man date**, to see where I was going wrong (for instance, I was using upper case M for Month, causing an error, since upper case M refers to Minute while lower case m refers to month). To exit the man page, I used **q**."
