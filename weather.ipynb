Since this file did not yet exist, the command created the file the first time it was run, and then appended the output to the same file the following 10 times. I then used the command **more now.txt** to verify that the text file contained the contents I wanted. I discovered I had only repeated the command 9 times instead of 10.\n",

This effectively read the contents of the now.txt file in my home directory and appended it to the now.txt file that was in my timestamps folder. I took care to ensure I had used \">>\" rather than \">\", as the latter would have overwritten my existing now.txt file.\n",
